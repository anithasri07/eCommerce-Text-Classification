# eCommerce-Text-Classification
This repository demonstrates an NLP-based approach for classifying eCommerce product descriptions into predefined categories using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and model training with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.

# eCommerce Text Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

This repository demonstrates how to perform text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The task involves classifying eCommerce product descriptions into predefined categories based on the description text.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **eCommerce Text Classification Dataset**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-text-classification?select=ecommerceDataset.csv). It contains product descriptions and their respective categories.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the category of a product based on its description. The steps involved include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, removing irrelevant information, and tokenizing text.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Transform the text data into a format suitable for machine learning models using techniques like TF-IDF.
3. **Model Building**: Train various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) to classify product descriptions into categories.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
